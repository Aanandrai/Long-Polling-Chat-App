# 📡 Long Polling Chat App Backend

This backend implements a **real-time chat system** using **long polling** with Node.js and Express (ES module syntax). It is designed for HTTP-only environments, providing instant message delivery without WebSockets.

## 🧠 How Each Component Works

### 1. `index.js` (Entry Point)
- Starts the Express server by importing and running the app from `src/app.js`.

### 2. `src/app.js` (Express App Setup)
- Configures Express, middleware (like `express.json()`), and mounts all routes.
- Imports and uses message and user routes.

### 3. `src/routes/messageRoutes.js`
- Defines endpoints for:
  - `GET /api/messages/poll` — for clients to wait for new messages (long polling).
  - `POST /api/messages` — for sending a new message to all waiting clients.

### 4. `src/controllers/messageController.js`
- **Long Polling Logic:**
  - Maintains an in-memory array (`clients[]`) of waiting client responses.
  - `getMessages(req, res)`:
    - Adds the client's response object to `clients[]`.
    - Sets up a `close` event to remove disconnected clients (avoids memory leaks).
    - Does **not** respond immediately; waits for a message or timeout.
  - `sendMessage(req, res)`:
    - Validates and extracts the message from `req.body`.
    - Sends the message to all waiting clients by responding to each stored response.
    - Clears the `clients[]` array after broadcasting.
    - Responds to the sender with success.

### 5. `src/controllers/userController.js` & `src/routes/userRoutes.js`
- (Optional) For user management if needed in the future.

## 📝 Long Polling Theory

- **Long polling** is a technique for real-time updates over HTTP.
- The client sends a request and the server holds it open until new data is available or a timeout occurs.
- When a message is available, the server responds and the client immediately re-issues the poll request, creating a loop.

**Why use long polling?**
- Works everywhere HTTP works (no WebSockets needed).
- Simple to implement and deploy.
- Good for low-to-moderate traffic real-time needs.

---

## ✅ Workflow

1. **Client polls for messages:**
   - `GET /api/messages/poll`
   - Server stores the response and waits for a message or timeout.

2. **Client sends a message:**
   - `POST /api/messages` with `{ message: "..." }`
   - Server broadcasts the message to all waiting clients.

3. **Timeout Handling:**
   - If no message arrives within the timeout (e.g., 20–30s), server responds with `{ message: null }` or `{}`.
   - Client immediately re-polls.

---

## ⏱ Server Timeout Best Practices

- Always set a timeout (e.g., 20–30 seconds) for each poll request.
- Respond with an empty or null message if no new data.
- Prevents hanging connections and memory leaks.

---

## 🌐 Frontend Considerations

### ❓ Does Long Polling Block Other Frontend Requests?

✅ **No**, long polling **does not block** other requests by default.

### ✅ Why Not?

- **Modern browsers** can handle multiple concurrent HTTP requests:
  - Typically **6–10 per domain**.
- A long polling call just uses **one slot**.
- Other API calls (`POST`, `GET`, etc.) can happen **in parallel**.
- JavaScript event loop and `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest` are **non-blocking**.

> ✔️ Long polling **does not** block the event loop  
> ✔️ But **bad design** or hitting browser connection limits **can** cause issues  
> ✔️ Solution: Use efficient long polling strategies

---

## ⏱ Recommended Server Timeout

### ⏳ Server-Side Handling

- Timeout after **20–30 seconds**, even if **no message** is available.
- Respond with:
  - `{ message: null }`,  
  - `"no updates"`, or  
  - an empty JSON (`{}`).

- The **client should immediately re-send** the polling request to keep the cycle going.

---

## 🔁 Why Set a Timeout?

- ✅ Prevents hanging connections.
- ✅ Ensures clients re-sync regularly.
- ✅ Reduces risk of memory/resource leaks on server/browser.
- ✅ Enables error recovery if the server crashes or the connection is lost.

---

## 🚫 What If You Don’t Handle Timeouts?

- ❌ Browser may hold the request **forever**.
- ❌ If server crashes or disconnects, **client won’t know**.
- ❌ Causes **memory leaks** and **poor user experience**.

## 💬 API Endpoints

```http
GET  /api/messages/poll      # Initiate long polling (wait for new messages)
POST /api/messages           # Send a message to all waiting clients
POST   /api/users/heartbeat — Notify server user is online
GET    /api/users/online — Get list of online users
```

## 🚩 Revision Notes

- **Long polling** is a fallback for real-time updates when WebSockets are not available.
- **Always clean up** disconnected clients to avoid memory leaks.
- **Timeouts are essential** for reliability and resource management.
- **Stateless:** Each poll is independent; clients must re-poll after every response.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
3. Use the API endpoints as described above.
